# 🎯 Objective

I started this repository as part of my journey to explore Generative AI and agentic systems.  
Here, I implement my learnings and build practical applications around AI-powered assistants and smart troubleshooting tools.  
While I come from a strong software engineering background, this marks my transition into the world of AI.  
My goal is to learn in public, share my progress, and connect with other talented individuals in the field.

This repository contains **Streamlit-powered AI apps** that demonstrate various concepts in Generative AI and intelligent automation.  
You can access the UI interface [here](https://explore-agentic-ai.streamlit.app/).

# 🧠 List of Apps

### [ 🛠️ Smart IT Troubleshooting Assist](https://learn-ai.streamlit.app/Simple_RAG)

<img src="resources/static/smart_it_troubleshoot.jpeg" width="400" height="250">


This application is designed to assist IT professionals in diagnosing and resolving technical issues using AI. Users can upload **PDF troubleshooting guides** and interact with the system through natural language queries to receive context-aware, intelligent insights.

Built on a Multi-Agent Agentic AI design using LangGraph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it combines semantic retrieval with LLM reasoning, coordinated by a Supervisor Agent. A human-in-the-loop Slack integration allows users to selectively share key troubleshooting steps and takeaways with support teams, enhancing collaboration and knowledge flow.

# 📌 Note

I will be continuously adding new apps to explore different concepts in Generative AI, including RAG variants, agentic workflows, and domain-specific assistants.  
Stay tuned for updates!
