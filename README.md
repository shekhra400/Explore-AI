# üéØ Objective

I started this repository as part of my journey to explore Generative AI and agentic systems.  
Here, I implement my learnings and build practical applications around AI-powered assistants and smart troubleshooting tools.  
While I come from a strong software engineering background, this marks my transition into the world of AI.  
My goal is to learn in public, share my progress, and connect with other talented individuals in the field.

This repository contains **Streamlit-powered AI apps** that demonstrate various concepts in Generative AI and intelligent automation.  
You can access the UI interface [here](https://explore-ai.streamlit.app/).

### [ üõ†Ô∏è Smart IT Troubleshooting Assist](https://learn-ai.streamlit.app/Simple_RAG)

<img src="resources/static/smart_it_troubleshoot.jpeg" width="400" height="250">

This application is built to support IT professionals in efficiently diagnosing and resolving technical issues using AI.  
It enables users to upload documents such as system logs, technical manuals, and error reports, and interact with the system through natural language queries to receive intelligent, context-aware insights.

The app leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance the accuracy of responses by combining document retrieval with large language model (LLM) capabilities.  
At its core, it follows a **Multi-Agent Agentic AI design pattern**, where a **Supervisor Agent** dynamically interprets the user's prompt and orchestrates the appropriate agents and tools based on the available resources.

Once a response is generated, the system optionally integrates with a **Slack tool** to send the troubleshooting message directly to an IT support Slack channel, streamlining communication and accelerating issue resolution.

# üìå Note

I will be continuously adding new apps to explore different concepts in Generative AI, including RAG variants, agentic workflows, and domain-specific assistants.  
Stay tuned for updates!
